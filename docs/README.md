# Project Documentation

This folder contains all project documentation.

## Structure

- `FEATURES.md` - List of all planned features and functionalities (for reference and future planning)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture and solutions overview
- `updates/` - Daily session logs named `YYYY-MM-DD_UPDATE.md`

## How We Work

1. **Slow and steady** - One feature at a time
2. **Simple first** - We avoid overcomplicating things
3. **Document as we go** - Each session gets logged

---

*This documentation system will grow as the project evolves.*
